Data recovery is a complicated process that requires care and attention to be done properly. Look through the scenarios below to decide which method of data recovery you will need to do.

> [!CAUTION] Caution
> If you are seeing "cyclic redundancy check" anywhere, you will not be able to attempt recovery at home and should seek professional data recovery services.

## Scenarios

### A readable disk (Live Linux Session)
A small obstacle preventing you from using your computer like normal such as:
- Your computer won't turn on for some reason
- Your computer is BSODing when you turn it on so you cannot get to Windows like normal.
- Your laptop screen broke so you can't see anything
- You cannot log into Windows for some reason

For these issues, you can [recover files by attaching your disk to another computer](/disks/data-recovery/drive-dock) or [recover files with a Live Linux Session](/disks/data-recovery/reading-linux).

### My disk is physically failing (gddrescue/Safecopy)
Your disk is showing signs of hardware failure and you need to create a safe copy before attempting any other recovery methods. This may be because:
- Your disk is making clicking, grinding, or beeping sounds
- You are seeing "bad sectors" or "read errors" in event logs or SMART data
- Your disk keeps disconnecting or is not detected consistently
- File transfers from the disk are extremely slow or freeze
- The disk is showing signs of physical damage or deterioration

For these issues, use [gddrescue](/disks/data-recovery/gddrescue) or [Safecopy](/disks/data-recovery/safecopy) to create an image of the failing disk before attempting any other recovery methods.

### My disk is visible but inaccessible (Testdisk)
You have a drive that is visible in Windows but it has no data on it. This may be because:
- You deleted partitions on the wrong disk (But did not make new ones)
- You turned your computer on and it says your disk needs to be "initialized"
- Your disk is "RAW" in disk management
- Your disk is "unknown" in disk management
- Your disk is "unallocated" in disk management

For these issues, use [Testdisk](/disks/data-recovery/testdisk) to recover your partition table.

### I accidentally changed data on my disk (Photorec)
You had data on your disk, and it had new data written to it, replacing the old data.
- You formatted the wrong disk
- You installed Windows on the wrong disk
- You installed Linux on the wrong disk
- You formatted and then put data onto the wrong disk

For these issues, use [Photorec](/disks/data-recovery/photorec) to recover individual files.
