Clonezilla is a free, open-source tool for disk imaging and cloning, ideal for backing up data from a failing drive before it fails completely. 

It can create an image of the entire drive or clone it to another drive, and it intelligently handles bad sectors to maximize data recovery. Clonezilla runs from a bootable live media, so you will need to create a bootable USB or CD/DVD with Clonezilla to use it. Alternatively, you may utilize the rTS Debian live media created in [this guide](/live-sessions/linux-live-session) which already comes with Clonezilla pre-installed.

## Installing Clonezilla
> [!NOTE] Information
>
> `clonezilla` is one of the preinstalled packages for our [r/Techsupport Rescue Media](/live-sessions/linux-live-session). If you are using this live image, you may skip this section.

**Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint**: 
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install clonezilla
```

**Fedora / RHEL / CentOS / AlmaLinux**: Clonezilla is not available in the default repositories for these distros, so you will need to add the add the external repository:
```sh
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf copr enable sergiomb/clonezilla
sudo dnf install clonezilla --skip-broken
```

**Arch / Manjaro / CachyOS**:
```sh
sudo pacman -Syu clonezilla
```

## Using Clonezilla
Run `sudo clonezilla` to launch the text-based menu. Choose "device-device" for direct disk/partition cloning (e.g., failing drive to healthy one) or "device-image" for imaging.

It is recommended you select beginner mode if you have not used Clonezilla before, identify drives carefully with labels or lsblk, and use "-rescue" for bad sectors on failing drives. Images save to a mounted target directory; restore similarly.

## Limitations of Clonezilla and when to use other tools
The installed Clonezilla frontend cannot clone mounted or running system partitions reliably—unmount them first or use Live mode. Risk overwriting wrong drives; always verify source/target twice. 

> [!IMPORTANT] Important
> 
> For failing drives, expect partial reads; supplement with [ddrescue](/disks/data-recovery/gddrescue) if needed. Clonezilla is not suitable for network/PXE cloning (use [DRBL](https://drbl.org/)/[Clonezilla SE](https://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-SE/) for that).
