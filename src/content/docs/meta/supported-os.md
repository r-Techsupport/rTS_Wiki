## Windows Server on the Discord
The general view of Windows Server is that we do not provide support for it, as it may be used in a business environment. We will now look at it from a more holistic view, where the purpose of the system is taken into consideration. If a Windows Server system needs support, and it is for a business, then it will still be best to recommend that they go to their IT department or support for the business at hand. However, if it is in a homelab environment, then support can continue within reason, as long as it is not EOL (Windows Server 2008 and earlier at time of writing). Some topics may be best suited to other places like r/sysadmin and r/homelab.
