## Prerequisites

* A Windows ISO file downloaded from Microsoft such as [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10) or [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11).
* A currently working Windows installation (even temporary).
* At least **10 GB of free space** on your drive to create a temporary install partition.

3. Shrink the volume by at least **10,000 MB** (~10 GB) to create enough space for the installer.

4. After shrinking, a new block of unallocated space will appear. Right-click it, select **New Simple Volume**, format it as **FAT32**, and label it `INSTALL`.

## Method 2

* After downloading the ISO from Microsoft Website:

1. Double-click the downloaded ISO to mount it.

4. Open **Command Prompt as Administrator** then run the following command:

    ```Dism /Split-Image /ImageFile:C:\sources\install.wim /SWMFile:C:\sources\install.swm /FileSize:4700```

5. After splitting the Windows Image, delete it:
    
    ```del C:\sources\install.wim```

## Reboot into the installer

## Installing Windows

> [!CAUTION] Caution
>
> When you reach the partition selection screen, be sure **NOT** to delete the `INSTALL` partition until **after** the rest of Windows is installed. This will be the partition that shows up as 9.77GB in the list.

1. Navigate the initial menus until you get to the screen asking which type of installation you want.
2. Click "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)"

> [!TIP] Congratulations!
>
> Youâ€™ve now installed Windows without external media. This method can be reused any time you need to reinstall your windows without extra tools or drives, so long as you can still boot into Windows. Periodically updating the installation contents is advisable to avoid lengthy update sessions if you decide to use this as a reinstall tool.
