## What is a Linux Live Session

Linux is a great tool for troubleshooting. It can run off a USB drive in a live session. This allows you to use a wide range of tools to manipulate the disks, data, and hardware of your computer/OS without worrying about anything running on it.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### But I use Windows!
That's fine, a Linux live session can be used regardless of your operating system.
### I don't want to install Linux!
The live session does not install Linux onto your main disk, the computer just boots into a USB drive containing Linux. Your main disk won't be touched at all unless you choose to.
### I don't know Linux!
Our live session is designed to be very easy to use for Windows users to understand, so Windows users should find it pretty straightforward.

## 1. Obtaining media
### r/Techsupport Rescue Media
A Linux ISO has been made for r/Techsupport that has many of the proper tools pre-installed to make rescuing a system easier. If you are unfamiliar with Linux we recommend that you use this version. 

[Download](https://github.com/r-Techsupport/rTS_Debian/releases/latest/download/rTS_RescueMedia.iso)

[Source files for Debian live-build](https://github.com/r-Techsupport/rTS_Debian)

**The username and password for the media is `user` and `live`**

### Official XUbuntu Media
You may also use the official XUbuntu ISO and load your own tools as needed. It is Ubuntu-based, so follow standard Ubuntu (or Ubuntu/Debian apt) instructions for installing additional tools. 

[Download](https://xubuntu.org/download/)

## 2. Creating bootable media
This will require a USB drive that is at least the size of the ISO you downloaded.

import LinuxInstallMedia from '../../../_includes/embeds/create-linux-install-media.mdx';

<LinuxInstallMedia />

## 3. Boot the live media
1. Press your 'Boot menu' key when you power on the machine to access your boot options.
	* You may need to go through BIOS and change boot priority if you cannot find or hit the boot options key during boot.
2. Choose your USB
3. Once it boots select 'Try' or 'Live'
