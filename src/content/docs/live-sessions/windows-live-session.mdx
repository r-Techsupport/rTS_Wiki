## Creating bootable media
This will require a USB that is at least the size of the ISO you downloaded.
> [!CAUTION] Caution
> 
>All methods of creating boot media are destructive and will **WIPE** the USB flash drive or external disk.

### Windows

1. Download and run [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/)
2. Select “ISO Image” and then browse for the ISO image.
3. Select which flash drive you want to put the installer on.
4. Select the target system type, `GPT/UEFI` or `MBR/BIOS` 
	* For modern systems `GPT/UEFI` is preferred. For legacy systems use `MBR/BIOS`
5. Click “Start” and wait for it to finish.

### MacOS

1. Download and run [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
2. Select your downloaded ISO
3. Select your target drive
4. Click "Flash" and wait for it to finish.

### Ventoy (Windows and Linux)

Follow our [Ventoy guide](/guides/ventoy) to make one flash drive that can boot multiple ISO files, this is a more advanced method but suitable for power users who may not have heard about it before.

## Boot the live media
1. Press your `Boot override` key when you power on the machine to access your boot options.
	* You may need to go through BIOS and change boot priority if you cannot find or hit the boot options key during boot.
2. Choose your USB
