If your app is lagging, freezing, crashing, or not opening at all, here are some simple steps you can try to fix it. This guide explains what each step does and how to do it, for both Android and iOS devices.

**Before doing anything else**, restart your phone — a simple restart can fix many temporary issues as Apps malfunctioning. It’s also a good idea to check for system updates. Keeping your operating system up to date helps ensure apps run smoothly and stay compatible.

*Follow this steps in order:*

### 1. Check for App Updates (*Android & iOS*):
An outdated version of the app might be causing bugs or performance problems. Updates often include bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches.

- Open the `Google Play Store` / `App Store` and Search for the app

- If you see an Update button, tap it

Some system apps may have updates available through the device’s own app store (e.g Samsung Store). Be sure to check for updates there as well.

Once updated, open the app again to check if the issue is resolved.

### 2. Force Stop the App (*Android only*):
Sometimes an app continues running in the background even if you think you've closed it. If it's stuck or frozen, force stopping the app will shut it down completely and stop all background processes.

- Go to Settings and tap `Apps` or `Apps & notifications`

- Find and select the app then tap `Force Stop`

### 3. Clear Cache (*Android & iOS*):
Over time, apps store temporary files (called cache) to help them load faster. However, this cached data can become outdated or corrupted, which may cause the app to crash, slow down, or behave unpredictably.

**Android:**

- Go to Settings and tap `Apps` or `Apps & notifications`

- Find and select the app then tap `Clear Cache` / Depends on the phone you may need to tap `Storage` then `Clear Cache`

**iOS:**

To clear cache on iOS, you can offload the app instead. This deletes the app but keeps your data, effectively clearing the cache.

- Go to Settings and tap `General` then `iPhone Storage`

- Find and select the app then tap `Offload App`

- Tap on `Reinstall App`

### 4. Clear App Data (*Android only*):
This resets the app to how it was when you first installed it. **It removes all saved settings, preferences, accounts, and any other stored information** — which can be helpful if corrupted data is causing issues.

- Go to Settings and tap `Apps` or `Apps & notifications`

- Find and select the app then tap `Clear Data` / Depends on the phone you may need to tap `Storage` then `Clear Data`

### 5. Reinstall the App (*Android & iOS*):
If nothing else works, try uninstalling and reinstalling the app.

- Tap and hold the app icon, select `Uninstall`

- Go to the `Google Play Store` / `App Store` and reinstall the app



If none of these steps work, the issue might be on the app’s side — for example, the app’s servers could be temporarily down, or there may be a bug that needs to be fixed by the developers. You can try contacting the app’s support for help.
