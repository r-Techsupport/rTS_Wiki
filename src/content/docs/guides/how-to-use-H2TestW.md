This guide will guide you through using H2TestW to help you determine the legitimacy of a storage drive.

## What is H2TestW?
H2TestW is a program designed to help test the actual size of your storage devices, as opposed to what is advertised. This tool was created in response to counterfeit drives that did not match their advertised capacity being sold (such as a 32GB SD card with a reported capacity of 2TB).

> [!CAUTION] Caution
> You should ensure that you are not running H2testW on a drive with sensetive information. The target drive should be empty.
