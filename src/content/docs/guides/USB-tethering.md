# No network available on the device

If you have installed/reinstalled Windows, and notice you do not have any WiFi/Ethernet drivers available to connect to the internet, or your WiFi/Ethernet device has stopped working leaving you with a device incapable of connecting to the network, you can temporarily provide network access to the device in question via USB Tethering.

This involves utilizing the network capabilities of an Android phone and using it as a WiFi dongle.

TODO:
- Start out with Windows and Android first
- Mention that android phones cannot be used on Macs
- Move onto Windows and iPhones, but mention that the windows device must have iTunes preinstalled (no you cannot install itunes via an iPhone as file browsing capabilities also rely on itunes)
    - Follow this guide if user has itunes: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255456736?sortBy=rank
