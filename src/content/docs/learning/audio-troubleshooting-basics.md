Please follow the troubleshooting steps in order; if any step changes/fixes the issue, please report which step this was and what happened. You do not need to complete all the steps if your issue gets resolved early.

## For all devices
  1. (On desktops): try plugging directly into the motherboard

  2. Remove any splitters or USB dongles

  3. Try plugging into your monitor headphone jack (if it has one)

  4. Try plugging into a different device.

## For headsets (with microphones)
  4a.  If the cable ends in a single 3.5mm headphone jack, test the headset using a different device that has a combo jack, e.g. a phone or laptop

## For all devices:
  5. Test the device using a Linux live USB. Type ?ubuntu for steps on how to do this. Note: this will not make any changes to your disks; this step is used to see if the issue is only present in Windows or not.
