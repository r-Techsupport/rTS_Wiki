### Hardware

* Having monitor issues? Change cable, use monitor on different computer. (Actually many hardware components should be tested first on other computers before reporting)

* If you bought a new device and it's not working properly, RMA the defective product.

* Max supported RAM for a 32 bit windows installation is 4GB

* Using a normal vacuum to clean your computer free of dust can cause damage

* Everyday computing (email, browsing and office apps) rarely uses more than 6GB RAM

* Hardware does not slow down over time. A format and reload will always make your computer fast again.

* For typical home users, if you already have more than 8GB then adding RAM will rarely make your computer faster.

* Workstations should be retired every 3-5 years.

* If you have a computer that won't boot sometimes turning it off, turning off and unplugging the PSU, and then holding the power button for over 10 seconds will fix it.

* A computer needs to be cleaned on a regular basis, and many shops will do this as part of a "tune-up" service if you're unwilling or able to do it yourself.

* Get a UPS for your Wireless Router and cable-modem.

* Get a UPS for your desktop computer. Your Laptop is a UPS.

* Replace your 20 year old power strip. Now.

* Laptops should be picked up by the base, and not by the screen.

* Laptops suck cold air in through the bottom. If you're using the computer in bed, keep it on a tray or similar, as a duvet or pillow will "choke" it.

* Once in a while restart/shut down your computer, especially if you have windows update enabled. It will allow your computer to install the updates and remove unnecessary files.

* When power cycling hardware (unplugging from wall and then plugging back in) always wait at least 10 seconds before plugging back in.

### Networking

* Having internet issues? Check the same issues on other devices in the network.

* 2.4GHz is slower but has better range. 5GHz is faster but less range.

* When encountering connectivity problems right click on the "Network Internet access" icon in the notification area and select "Troubleshoot problems".

### Internet & Internet security

* Don't open attachments that are unexpected.

* Don't allow remote connection to your computer to anyone you don't know or trust.

* Always use an adblocker like UBlock Origin, it may save you from accidentally installing malicious software.

* Alt-F4 is the shortcut to close a window on Windows -- useful for unwanted pop-ups.

* Clicking unknown links during a google search is a very common way of being infected with malware.

* Never reuse passwords -- consider using a [password manager](/safety-security/pw-managers).

* There are 8 bits in a byte. Therefore, 100 Megabit per second (Mb) equals to 12.5 Megabyte (MB).

* Don't log into accounts on computers you don't trust as they may be infected and steal your account details. Think about PCs in internet cafes and other public locations.

* Don't save your passwords on unknown computers either.

* Enable [2-factor authentication](/safety-security/mfa) on your accounts (where possible) to improve security.

* Don't include personal information in your passwords (date of birth, your name, etc).

* Using something like "Chinese_llama_fridge_transporter" as password is easier to remember, longer, harder to randomly guess and harder to brute-force than "W@chtw00rd" or other random character combinations.

* You can close browser tabs and it may help make your computer faster.

* Browser extensions frequently make the browser slower.

* You do need an antivirus, even if you think you're "good with computers". Windows has one built-in, however, so an extra one is unnecessary.

* Prefer HTTPS over HTTP when browsing the web.

* Don't submit credit card details over insecure connections, i.e. HTTP. If a site asking for your CC info is insecure, you're better off not using it in the first place.

* Never tell anyone your passwords, not even people claiming to be employees of Google, Microsoft, Apple, or any other major company.

* Microsoft will never call you on the phone for any reason.

### Software, maintenance & malware prevention

* Using auto driver updaters can cause damage to your operating system and is not recommended. We talk about our stance and instructions on drivers [here](/recommendations/maintenance)

* Office and Windows versions do not have to match.

* Format and reload is always more thorough and often faster than manually trying to clean up a messy infection.

* The built-in reset tools are not a full reinstall of Windows. See our [disambiguation page](/windows) for a guide on doing a proper clean install.

* Defragging your drive is an outdated and unnecessary ritual. Modern operating systems will avoid disk fragmentation automatically.

* Bundled software is typically inferior to the built in Windows features (Photos, WiFi management, anti-virus, etc). You do not need it and can uninstall it.

* Keep all of your software up to date.

* A full reboot/restart fixes more issues than you'd imagine.

* If you don't know what a setting does, you likely shouldn't be touching it.

* [Treesize Free](https://customers.jam-software.de/downloadTrial.php?language=EN&article_no=80) is a good way to see which files are filling up your hard drive.

* You shouldn't touch anything in the C:\Windows folder unless you know what you're doing.

* You should never touch anything in the registry, including using registry cleaners.

* System cleaners and optimizers can do more harm then good, and often don't increase performance at all.

* If you see a file and you didn't make it, don't delete it unless you're 100% sure its not important.

* Software security becomes practically useless once an attacker gains physical access to a device.

* You don't need to update your BIOS unless you're 100% certain that the current version is the cause of your problems. If possible, let a professional do it because quite a lot could go wrong.

* If your computer crashes, trying undoing the last thing you did to it via system restore.

* If you don't have a clear, absolute understanding of what any program does and how it will be useful to you, don't run it.

* Same applies to other files which could alter your system configuration, common formats of which include: .bat, .ps1, .vbs, , .js, .reg and .cmd.

* Enable showing extensions in File Explorer. This will allow you to identify malware using the double extension trick (e.g. "filename.jpg.exe").

* Always uncheck any "additional offers" that programs may offer during installation. They're usually garbage that will bog your system down.

* If a computer is constantly restarting, go into the Control Panel/System/Advanced System Settings/Startup and Recovery/System Failure and uncheck "Automatically restart" so you can see the error that's causing it.

### Data security

* You should backup your data. Checkout [our backup guide.](/backups)

* A backup stored on the same drive doesn't count as a backup! Upload them to a cloud service or on an external HDD/network drive.

* Not backing up your data is planning to lose your data. Data loss is rarely predictable. 

### Purchase Advice

* The less you spend on a new computer, the more likely it is to be slow/break.

* Power supplies are important, don't cheap out on them. [Here](https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/1116640-psu-tier-list-40-rev-41) is a buying guide for power supplies. Buying a cheap power supply can damage the rest of your hardware.

* There is zero additional risk in buying refurbished products that are under warranty, and they cost a lot less. It's a good idea.

* Please research specs before buying a PC/laptop, just because it was released this year does not mean it's blazing fast, there is such thing called "entry level". If it's cheap, understand it may be slow.

### Misc

* The key between CTRL and ALT on most keyboards is the [Windows Key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_key).

* Many keys have more functions. The "Shift", "Ctrl", "Alt" and "FN" keys can each make a key do a different thing.
