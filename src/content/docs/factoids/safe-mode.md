Windows has a troubleshooting mode called safe mode, where Windows will load only critical drivers and services necessary for proper function. It is especially useful when issues exist in normal mode or when uninstalling drivers used by Windows.
All non-critical drivers and services will not be loaded. For example for graphics Windows will use a generic driver instead of one provided by vendor like Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc. Services for gaming platforms, anti-cheats, peripheral controls, audio software wont run unless explicitly started.

Windows in safe mode will have a limited resolution, black background, and will display `Safe mode` text in corners as well as build version on top of desktop.
