## Using the Windows media creation tool "Update now" option
To force update Windows 11 download the "Windows 11 Installation Assistant" [from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11) then run it.

## Using a mounted ISO
If the Windows 11 installation assistant fails to update Windows and you are on an old version number of Windows, you can try downloading then mounting the "ISO" file for the OS.

1. Download the "ISO" from the "Download now" button under "Download Windows 11 Disk image (ISO) for ... devices" on the [Windows 11 download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11).
    - You may need to choose several options from dropdowns and choose "Download now" several times.
2. Once you have the ISO downloaded double click the file to mount it, it will appear as a CD drive under "This PC"
3. Open the drive and run "setup.exe" to attempt the update again.

## Using a USB
This is perhaps the best method of the three. This will also wipe any data stored on the USB flash drive that is used.

1. Create the install media from Part 1 of our [Windows 11](/installations/install-11/#creating-installation-media) install guides.
2. Open the created USB in File Explorer and run "setup.exe" to force upgrade Windows.
