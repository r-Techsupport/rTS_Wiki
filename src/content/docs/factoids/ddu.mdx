## What is DDU?
Display Driver Uninstaller is a program that can fully wipe display/audio drivers, to troubleshoot various issues.

> DDU does not erase any personal files. It only wipes the selected driver(s), and any associated info, such as display color profiles, settings, and associated software such as the NVIDIA app or AMD Adrenalin/Radeon software and their settings.

## Installing DDU
import InstallDDU from '../../../_includes/embeds/ddu_install.md';

### Laptops or integrated graphics

To wipe display drivers for laptops/devices with onboard graphics: Select the "GPU" device type from the drop-down list on the right. 

* Select the `Clean and do NOT restart` option for the first driver, _then_ the `Clean and restart` option for the second driver. Any GPU driver can be wiped first, the order is irrelevant.

### Desktops with a dedicated GPU
To wipe display drivers from a dedicated GPU: Select the "GPU" device type from the drop-down list on the right, select the GPU driver you wish to uninstall, and click `Clean and restart`
