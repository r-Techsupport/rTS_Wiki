## What is DDU?
Display Driver Uninstaller is a program that can fully wipe display/audio drivers, to troubleshoot various issues.

> [!NOTE] Note
>
> DDU does not erase any personal files. It only wipes the selected driver and associated software.

## Installing DDU
import InstallDDU from '../../../_includes/embeds/ddu_install.md';

## Wiping Display Drivers

> [!WARNING] Warning
> 
> Make sure you are in [Safe Mode](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode) for the following steps.

### Laptops or integrated graphics

To wipe display drivers for laptops/devices with onboard graphics: Select the "GPU" device type from the drop-down list on the right. 

* Select the `Clean and do NOT restart` option for the first driver, _then_ the `Clean and restart` option for the second driver. Any GPU driver can be wiped first, the order is irrelevant.

### Desktops with a dedicated GPU
To wipe display drivers from a dedicated GPU: Select the "GPU" device type from the drop-down list on the right, select the GPU driver you wish to uninstall, and click `Clean and restart`
