## What is DDU?
Display Driver Uninstaller is a program that can fully wipe display/audio drivers, to troubleshoot various issues.

> DDU does not erase any personal files. It only wipes the selected driver(s), and any associated info, such as display color profiles, settings, etc.

## Installing DDU
import InstallDDU from '../../../_includes/embeds/ddu_install.md';

### Laptops or integrated graphics

To wipe display drivers for laptops/devices with onboard graphics: Select the "GPU" device type from the drop-down list on the right. 

* Select the `Clean and do NOT restart` option for the first driver, _then_ the `Clean and restart` option for the second driver. Any GPU driver can be wiped first, the order is irrelevant.

### Desktops with a dedicated GPU
To wipe display drivers from a dedicated GPU: Select the "GPU" device type from the drop-down list on the right, select the GPU driver you wish to uninstall, and click `Clean and restart`
