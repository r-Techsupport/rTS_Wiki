# Reading Machine Temperatures & Voltages

Watching your temperatures is an important part of managing any machine, especially a gaming rig. There are several tools that can work for this, some may not work on all CPUs (Ryzen most notably).

When reporting your temperatures to people, please use Celsius. It doesn't matter what country you are in, everyone uses Celsius for computers.

## Specify
This is an all around system reporting tool. We use this actively in our [Discord live chat](/discord) to gather system information, including temperatures reported by various sensors.

You can download Specify [here](https://spec-ify.com/download). Temperatures (including their corresponding sensors) are listed in the "Temps" section of the Specify report.

### Get-Specs
Alternatively, you can use Get-Specs to gather similar information.

You can download Get-Specs [here](https://github.com/r-Techsupport/Get-Specs/releases/latest/download/Get-Specs.zip). Temperatures are listed in the "Hardware Basics" section of the report.

> ℹ️ **For more information on how to use Specify and Get-Specs, please see our guide on [making a system dossier](docs/guides/making-a-system-dossier.md).**

## Ryzen Master
The go-to for ensuring you get proper temperature readings for your Ryzen CPU. If other tools show the same temperature you can assume they are accurate.

## HWiNFO
Like Specify, this has a ton of info, but it is isolated to hardware. We utilize this for extended logging of voltages, temps, etc. during stress tests.
