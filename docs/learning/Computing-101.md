## Installing Programs
Installing programs is a little bit more work. Navigate to the website of the program you would like to install and download the latest version from there. Then once you download the program you will have to run the setup or .exe for the program to install. Afterwards you are free to use that program. 

For example, a program that you might want to install would be discord which you can find [here](https://discord.com/). You would click the download button and run the exe to install. You would do this with any program that you wanted to install. 

> Avoid downloading software from sites like Softpedia, these are rarely official and often harbor malicious software instead of the clean legitamate product you are searching for.

### Sites to avoid:
- Softpedia
- FileHippo
- Filehorse
- CNET
- Softonic

## Uninstalling Programs
> ❗ To uninstall programs, you do not want to manually delete the files associated with the program.

You want to fully uninstall which would remove the associated files, settings, registry keys, etc. There are a few ways to do this. 

One way is to click on the start menu, find the program you want to uninstall then right click on their icon, from there you can select uninstall. 

This should bring up a new window that has a huge list of programs. In that window you highlight the program you want to uninstall, and at the top of the list you can click on Uninstall. 

You can follow the prompts to remove the program from the computer. You can do this with any unwanted program.

## Ending Processes
Ending a process that might not be responding is a task everyone should know. 

To do this you open Task Manager, you can do this by hitting the `ctrl + shift + esc` keys on your keyboard at once. This should open task manager to the processes tab which is where to be to end a process. 

From there you highlight the process you wish to end or the process that is not responding. Afterwards in the bottom right corner of the window you will hit the end task button. Be careful when you are in here ending some background processes could cause more issues and would require a reboot to fix. 

## Rebooting
Sometimes as the user you will run into an issue with your computer. Before reaching out for help try a reboot to see if that fixes the issue. 

You can do this hitting the start button, from there hit the power icon and select restart. Another way is hitting the reboot button on your computer. 

This is a common first step to troubleshooting and will fix some problems that you are experiencing. Otherwise you can view our other guide that goes into a little more details about problems [here](basic-troubleshooting.md) or check out some [general guides](/docs/guides).
